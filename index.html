					<p class="margins1">Hi! I am Giovanni Budi and a data-driven problem solver with over 7 years of experience across business analytics, data engineering, quality assurance, and project management. I hold a Master’s in Business Analytics from the University of South Carolina and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from NC State University.</p>
					<p class="margins1">I’m passionate about using data to drive better decision-making, uncover insights, and build solutions that create real business value. Whether it's cleaning messy datasets, building predictive models, or streamlining workflows, I thrive at the intersection of data, strategy, and impact.</p>

					<h2>University of South Carolina - Athletics</h2>
					<h3 class="margins3 subtitle"> Research Analyst – Built predictive models to reduce no-shows and improve fan engagement using Python and Power BI </h3>
					<p class="margins3"><strong>January 2025 – Present</strong></p>
					<p class="margins3">
						At University of South Carolina Athletics Department, I leveraged Python and machine learning to analyze ticket sales and attendance data, building predictive models to estimate the likelihood of fan no-shows. I identified key drivers of attendance such as opponent strength, ticket type, and purchasing behavior. To effectively communicate risk levels to stakeholders, I implemented the model within Power BI, using geographic heat maps to visually highlight high-risk ticket buyer segments by location. These insights assisted in developing targeted strategies including loyalty rewards programs and resale incentives, helping to reduce no-show rates, enhance fan engagement, and support data-driven decisions across marketing and operations.

					<h2>ATI Specialty Materials</h2>
					<h3 class="margins3 subtitle"> Data Scientist – Led cross-functional analytics initiatives using Python, SQL, Power BI, JMP, and Databricks to improve operations and quality </h3>
					<p class="margins3">
						During my 5 years at ATI Specialty Materials, I led and contributed to numerous cross-functional data initiatives that enhanced operational efficiency and supported strategic business goals. I collaborated with finance teams to define reporting requirements and built dynamic dashboards in Power BI and ThingWorx, improving real-time visibility into financial and operational performance. Working with DBAs, I developed and maintained ETL pipelines using SQL and Databricks, ensuring reliable data flow across systems. I partnered with engineers to conduct analytical investigations using Python and JMP, and worked with the quality assurance team to create predictive models that identified potential product defects. These efforts collectively drove data-informed decision-making, reduced process variability, and strengthened alignment across technical and business units.

					<h2>Siemens</h2>
					<h3 class="margins3 subtitle"> Software Developer – Built a customizable data dashboard application using Django, Selenium, and Python </h3>
					<p class="margins3">
						As a software developer, I developed a dashboard generator application using the Django framework in Python, enabling the visualization of any data set within Siemens' database based on user-defined parameters such as tables, charts, and filters. To ensure the application’s functionality, I wrote comprehensive unit tests using Python’s unit test framework and Selenium for automated testing. I also created a user guide to help clients navigate the application and a developer guide to facilitate future development. Throughout the software development cycle, I collaborated closely with clients, gathering requirements, designing the application, and iterating through implementation and testing phases to ensure a seamless user experience and robust performance.

					<h2>North Carolina State University</h2>
					<h3 class="margins3 subtitle"> Research Assistant – Automated data workflows with Excel VBA to accelerate research analysis and reporting </h3>
					<p class="margins3">
						During my 1.5 years as a Research Assistant at North Carolina State University, I collaborated with multiple research teams to support their data analysis needs and contribute to the development of detailed reports and presentations. I designed and implemented Excel VBA scripts to automate data extraction and consolidation workflows, reducing manual processing time by 99%. This efficiency boost allowed teams to focus more on research insights and improved the overall quality and consistency of project deliverables.

					<h2>Alpek Polyester</h2>
					<h3 class="margins3 subtitle"> IT Engineer – Built internal tools and improved SSRS reporting systems to enhance data reliability and operational efficiency </h3>
					<p class="margins3">
						As an engineer, I led efforts to develop and enhance data storage architecture, methods, and procedures across the organization to improve data accessibility and reliability. I designed and built a hardware loaning application that streamlined the electronics loaning process across all plant sites, reducing manual tracking and improving accountability. Additionally, I enhanced SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports by incorporating data validation checks and user-friendly error messaging, which significantly improved user experience and reduced reporting errors.

					<h2>Reducing “No-Shows” at UofSC Athletic Events</h2>
					<p class="margins3">
						Not all ticket purchasers attend the games, leading to “no-shows” and a decline in true attendance.
						These no-shows result in empty seats, a diminished atmosphere, lost concession revenue, and a weaker overall fan experience.
						UofSC Athletics sought to identify the factors driving attendance behavior and reduce future no-shows.
					</p>
					<p class="margins3">
						To support this goal, a team and I developed a predictive model (see the Model Portfolio tab for more details) to estimate the likelihood
						that a ticket holder would attend a given game. The model was implemented directly into our dashboard,
						where we visualized high-risk tickets on a geographic heat map.
					</p>
					<p class="margins3">This approach allowed us to:</p>
					<ul class="margins4">
						<li>Identify characteristics of fans most likely to skip games</li>
						<li>Quantify the key drivers of attendance</li>
						<li>Target specific ticket holders for engagement strategies</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="margins3">
						Ultimately, this project enabled data-driven decision-making to improve attendance and enhance the in-stadium experience.

					<h2>Spotify: Exploring Music Trends</h2>
					<p class="margins3">
						I created this interactive Power BI dashboard to explore the when, where, and why of evolving music trends, using Spotify data from 1999 to 2020. 
						Through a series of visualizations, the report analyzes changes in song popularity, energy, danceability, and other key musical attributes, while highlighting top genres and artists. 
						Users can apply filters to examine trends by year, genre, and popularity level, uncovering insights into shifting listener preferences and the attributes that define successful tracks over time.

					<h2>Understanding Traffic Crashes in the City of Chicago</h2>
					<p class="margins3">
						Traffic crashes are a major concern for public safety, infrastructure planning, and equitable resource allocation. 
						This dashboard was created to identify the when, where, and why of crashes, providing insights that help develop strategies to decrease both the frequency and severity of traffic incidents.
					</p>

					<p class="margins3">
						To achieve this, I created a series of visualizations that analyze crash trends over time, categorize crash types and severity, and display crash density through an interactive heat map by police beat. 
						Users can apply filters to examine crashes based on severity, time frame, and the presence of nearby traffic control devices. These filters provide deeper insights into contributing factors and high-risk 
						areas, allowing for a more targeted approach to understanding and mitigating traffic incidents.

					<h2>Identifying Skin Cancer Detection - ISIC 2024</h2>
					<p class="margins3">
						This project addresses the critical need for accessible skin cancer diagnostics in underserved regions by developing a deep learning-based detection system that works with smartphone-quality images. 
						Leveraging the ISIC SLICE-3D dataset and state-of-the-art EfficientNet architectures, we evaluate the impact of image quality on classification performance. Through transfer learning from high-resolution ISIC 2019 data, 
						we demonstrate how advanced AI can adapt to low-resource environments without compromising diagnostic accuracy, paving the way for broader, more equitable access to early skin cancer detection tools.
